      "crises and negative effects.  \n",
      "Therefore, in many countries future research  activities are developing, new institut ions are esta blished, \n",
      "new approaches are tested. In Egypt this trend has started slowly and only recently: \"Future studies are \n",

      "roots as well as reasons in the geopoliti cal positions of the West and oriental countries (see Edward \n",

For that reason this report presents an overview about the context conditions, \\nexperi ences and forms of future research in Egypt.

The main part is the description of the most important institutions, which are conduc ting \\nfuture research, their projects and in addition two concr ete projects, which try to practice Sustai nable \\nDevelopment in different ways.

It is a deeply human charactersistic  and a mea ns to protect from \\npossible problems and catastrophes, to prepare for challenge and threats. Some of the better  known \\nearly example s were practiced in the Middle Eastern region, some of them specifically in Pharaonic \\nEgypt. Different kinds of prophecies an d early forms of astrology can be cited, or the famous “Oracle \\nof Siwa ” in the Western Desert of Egypt, where Alexander the Great was asking about his personal \\nfate and the prospect for his plan to conquer the whole region as far as Northern Indian empires  (331 \\nB.C.).  \\nAn interesting example has been put into a wonderful literary form. The German literature Nobel Prize \\nlaureate Thomas Mann tells the classical story about Joseph (Yussuf), son of Isaac, in his three -\\nvolume work “Joseph and his Brothers”. Jose ph was taken away from Palestine to Pharaonic Egypt \\nsome 3.400 years ago. After some other activities and an amazing career he once had – so the biblical \\nvariation of the story goes –  two important dreams of Pharao Amenophis IV  are analysed .

He suggested that the pharao should prepare the country for these future challenges. The young \\nPharao trusted the impressive young wise man from Palestine, a nd ordered to build many storage \\nhouses all around Egypt and filled them with the surplus of the harvest of the first 7 years. Due to this \\nsmart preparation, Egypt was able to survive the severe crisis years which brought big troubles to \\nother peoples arou nd Egypt.  \\nModern thinking about future still relies to a certain extent on such sensitivity and intuition, but is of \\ncourse much more systematic and scientific. Modern future research uses all types of modern \\ncapacities, resources and tools for data gather ing, research, analyses and reflection.  \\n• Modern future thinking started in the U.S. military after World War II (RAND -corporation) \\nfor strategic pur poses and in corporations (like Shell ) \\n• Kybernetic models were used by experts like Norbert Wiener and He rman Kahn, and in 1972 \\nby Dennis Meadows et al.

Ancient church domes and medieval minarets share the same space with fast -food chains \\nand Internet cafes.

One can pay telephone bills on the \\nInternet, though more than half the population are illiterate.” (Zayan 2007: 8f.)  \\nIn the background of this polarized and  multifaceted situation and development social scientists and \\nintellectuals in Egypt find a certain tape of policies, a certain intended or unintended strategy, a kind \\nof hidden agenda, which many other countries have gone through or are still going throug h in their \\nprocess of change and survival and progress. In Egypt, nevertheless, a high degree of frustration and \\nfatalism among the citizenship can be sensed, connected to the activities of a political and security \\nelite which reproduces many of the still existing problems and challenges.

The management and the academic staff is being professionalized. The leadership of \\nIDSC has high expectations regarding the future functions and possibilities of the CFS. In a present a-\\ntion for a UNESCO -Workshop Prof. Mansour, CFS-Director has said : “Anti cipation and Foresight \\nwill become mor e important than they are today. Because it has to be thought about the complex \\neffects of new technologies, about the effects of their intera ction, about the effects of shortages in food \\nand other basic resources, abo ut the effects of conflicts on peace, about pollution and its effects on \\nhuman health, about advancing intercu ltural education and language skills, about changing cultural \\npattern like hyper -consumption, etc.” (Mansour 2008)  \\nThe official v ision of CFS is t o be “a  distinguished Egyptian think -tank in th e field of exploring the \\nfuture” and its m ission : “To be effective in continuously improving the awareness, understanding,'),\n",

Methods: An\\nepidemiological population-based study of 1137 Danishpatients with type 2 diabetes newly diagnosed by generalpractitioners (GPs). GPs and patients together filled in aquestionnaire about typical symptoms, signs and complica-tions preceding the diagnosis. Results: Abnormal thirst,\\nfrequent urination, weight loss, genital itching, stomatitis,visual disturbances, fatigue, confusion and (in men) balanitiswere associated with glycaemic level irrespective of age,sex, BMI, BP, complications and antihypertensive treat-ment. Eighty-nine percent of the patients presented with oneor more of these hyperglycaemic symptoms and signs,and the pre-diagnostic duration was typically less than 3months. Only a few symptoms, signs and complicationswere associated with weight and BP. Conclusions/inter-\\npretation: In patients newly diagnosed with type 2 dia-\\nbetes in family practice, typi cal diabetic symptoms, signs\\nand complications are common. Typical diabetic symp-toms and signs are associated with hyperglycaemia. Thepre-diagnostic duration of hyperglycaemic symptoms andsigns were typically short, thus questioning the feasibility ofearly detection relying on increased anticipatory care by GPs.In contrast, elevated levels of cardiovascular risk factors andlonger pre-diagnostic duration of cardiovascular complica-tions suggest these might have a central role in an early\\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes.\\nKeywords Complication .Epidemiology .Family\\npractice .Prevalence .Type 2 diabetes mellitus .Signs and\\nsymptoms\\nAbbreviations FPG: Fasting plasma glucose .GP:\\nGeneral practitioner .IQR: Interquartile range .UKPDS:\\nUnited Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study\\nIntroduction\\nThe long-term aim in the treatment of type 2 diabetic pa-tients is prevention of complications. Efforts to ameliorateimmediate symptoms and signs of diabetes might, however,improve patients ’quality of life in the short term and in-\\ncrease their motivation for lifestyle changes and medica-tion. Despite the central role of symptoms and signs in thetreatment of type 2 diabetes, few studies have studied theprevalence and duration of symptoms and signs at diabetesdiagnosis [ 1–7]. Associations between typical diabetic symp-\\ntoms and glycaemic level, blood pressure (BP), and weightare, furthermore, ambiguous and documented for a few symp-toms only [ 1,2]. Clearer insight into these associations might\\nhelp discover which symptoms and signs have a potential forimproving screening activity and treatment quality in newlydiagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.\\nWe report the prevalence and pre-diagnostic duration of\\ndiabetic symptoms, signs and complications, and their as-sociation with glycaemia, BP and weight, in a population-based sample of 1,137 patients with newly diagnosed type2 diabetes.\\nSubjects and methods\\nA total of 474 general practitioners (GPs) volunteered forthe study Diabetes Care in General Practice, a randomisedcontrolled trial of structured diabetes care [ 8].

Di-\\nagnosis of diabetes reflected normal diagnostic proceduresin Danish general practice, i.e. diagnosis was based onraised blood glucose values and/or typical diabetic symp-toms, and was subsequently confirmed by a single fastingwhole-blood (plasma) glucose sample ≥7.0 (8.0) mmoL/L[8].

Statistical significance was\\ndefined as a pvalue <0.05 (two-sided). All analyses were\\nrun on the personal computer statistics package SAS forWindows, version 8.2.\\nResults\\nBaseline characteristics of the patients are presented inTable 1.\\nClassic diabetic symptoms such as abnormal thirst,\\nfrequent urination and weight loss were common (Table 2),\\nand 628 of 1,137 patients (55.2%) reported at least two ofthese symptoms and 24.2% reported all three.\\nNo symptom, sign or complication other than the 16\\npredefined ones was reported by more than 3% of patients.Each of the glycaemic symptoms and signs had beenpresent for less than 3 months before diagnosis for most ofthe patients whereas cardiovascular complications hadoften been present for years (Table 2).\\nAfter multiple adjustments, six symptoms and signs, i.e.\\nabnormal thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, genitalitching, stomatitis and visual disturbances, were associatedwith both FPG and HbA\\n1c (Table 3). Furthermore, fatigue\\nand confusion were associated with FPG, and balanitis (inmen) with HbA\\n1c. Only one symptom was associated with\\nsystolic BP whereas two were associated with BMI. Thenine symptoms and signs associated with the glycaemiclevel were common and 89% of the patients presentedwith one or more of these.\\nWhen interpreting the odds ratios in Table 3, the\\nexponential relationship between the continuous indepen-dent variables and the symptom and signs should be no-ticed. For example, the odds ratio of having the symptomabnormal thirst is 1.37 times as high (1.17 to the powerof 2) for someone with an FPG=11 mmoL/L than for some-one with an FPG=9 mmoL/L (all other covariates beingthe same).\\nIn 861 of 1,137 patients (75.7%) GPs reported that the\\ndiagnostic blood glucose was measured because of thepresence of symptoms or acute disease. Other reasons thatled the GP to the initial glucose measurement were weightincrease (5.6%), previous sub-threshold elevation of bloodglucose (4.3%), or hypertension (3.2%). No other reasonswere stated for more than 3% of the study population.\\nDiscussion\\nIn newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, abnormal thirst,frequent urination, weight loss, genital itching, stomatitis,visual disturbances, fatigue, confusion and balanitis werecommon, of short pre-diagnostic duration, and associatedwith glycaemic level.A Dutch study from 1999 to 2001 [ 9] found that ap-\\nproximately 75% of diabetic patients newly diagnosed byGPs had one or more symptoms typical of diabetes, whichsuggests that the fraction of symptomatic patients haschanged little within the last decade despite changes indiagnostic criteria and increasing focus on the disease. Inthe United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)31.2% of the patients were described as asymptomatic [ 6];\\nthis low percentage most probably reflects the low diag-nostic cut-off level (6.0 mmoL/L) defining diabetes. In aUKPDS sub-sample ( n=438), at least one of 40 predefined\\nsymptoms and signs (present within the previous week)related either to hyperglycaemia, cardiovascular or respira-tory problems, or adverse consequences of drug treatment,was reported after 2 months of glucose-reducing dietarytreatment after diagnosis [ 1]. Next to differences between\\ndiagnostic criteria of diabetes, the large variations in typeand prevalence of symptoms between the few studies mostprobably reflect differences in questionnaire methodologyand study populations. Another important bias in all studies,including our own, might be that the prevalence of listeditems are likely to be overestimated whereas those not listedmight have been underestimated.\\nDuration of symptoms has been reported by two small\\naudits only [ 2,7]. The short duration of symptoms in our\\nstudy compared with these audits could be a consequenceof high motivation among our volunteering doctors, butthe relatively high level of diagnostic FPG contradicts thisexplanation.\\nPreviously, only the prevalence of dry mouth [ 1], thirst\\n[1,2], stomach pain [ 1], polyuria [ 2] and pruritus [ 2] has\\nbeen found to be associated with glycaemic level. The fewassociations found in these studies might be explained bythe timing of the interview and limited statistical power,because of the size of the study.\\nIn contrast with the few items found to be associated\\nwith systolic BP or with BMI in our multivariate analyses,the UKPDS sub-study found ten symptoms, signs andcomplications associated with BMI and four with systolicBP [1]. The lack of adjustment for diabetic complications\\nand treatment in the latter study might have biased thefindings.\\nOur results imply that GPs act on symptoms and signs\\nassociated with hyperglycaemia and do so reasonable well,because these symptoms and signs were of recent onset. Incontrast, very few GPs stated that elevated cardiovascularrisk factors and cardiovascular complications led them totest for diabetes. Danish guidelines at the time of the studydid not specifically ask GPs to test for diabetes amongpatients with elevated cardiovascular risk factors and cardio-vascular complications. It seem s likely, however, that clinical\\npractice might have changed within the last decade, andscreening for diabetes among patients with cardiovasculardisease, hypertension or dyslip idaemia has recently been sug-\\ngested in Denmark [ 10].\\nIn conclusion, our study provides new evidence on\\nseveral aspects of typical diabetic symptoms and signs.First, nine out of ten type 2 diabetic patients newly di-agnosed by the family practice presented with one or more213'),\n",

Second, our results\\nprovide documentation that nine well-recognised diabeticsymptoms are closely associated with hyperglycaemic levelwhereas few seem to be associated with overweight andelevated BP. Finally, because of the short duration of hy-perglycaemic symptoms and signs, our results indicate thatcompared with raising the awareness of hyperglycaemicsymptoms the use of screening models based on cardio-vascular risk seems to be a more promising means of earlydiagnosis of type 2 diabetes.\\nAcknowledgements We thank the patients and GPs who took part\\nin the study, Lise Bergsoe for secretarial assistance, and Maeve\\nDrewsen for linguistic revision of the paper.
